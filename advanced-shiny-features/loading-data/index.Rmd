Often a Shiny app will contain a visualisation or other element that takes a long time to load. It's useful to provide a visual aid to your users that content is being loaded (or something else is being done). This template provides a bare bones Shiny app with pulsating text that reads "loading data..." while a chart is being generated.

This template was inspired by Dean Attali ([http://stackoverflow.com/a/35665217/1659890](http://stackoverflow.com/a/35665217/1659890)).
