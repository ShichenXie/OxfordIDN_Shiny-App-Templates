This template provides a useful utility if your Shiny apps are typcially embedded into small iframes, like below, and displays an attractive "popout" button which will open the Shiny app in a new browser window:

<iframe src="https://trainingidn.shinyapps.io/shiny-template_popout-button?allowPopout=TRUE" width="100%" height="480px"></iframe>

## What is being shown?

This Shiny app is designed to respond to "allowPopout" query string in the URL, i.e.

```{HTML}
https://trainingidn.shinyapps.io/shiny-template_popout-button?allowPopout=TRUE/
```

The "query string" is everything after the "?", multiple "query parameters" could be given (but aren't coded for in this app) for instance: https://trainingidn.shinyapps.io/shiny-template_popout-button?allowPopout=TRUE&histColor=blue&histXAxis=foo

## shinyServer(function(input, output, *session*))

The `session` argument of the `shinyServer` function allows the server component of a Shiny app to receive information from the client machines displaying the Shiny app. It's perfectly safe to *always* include the `session` argument as it will preveny annoying errors from forgetting to include it.

For a detailed explanation of what's available from `session` see this [RStudio tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/client-data.html).

## uiOutput("url_allow_popout_UI")

The optional "popout" button is displayed on screen when `uiOutput("url_allow_popout_UI")` is called in the ui.R file. It is therefore crucial that it is called as early as possible, to assist in this it is adviseable to use `fluidPage` rather than having "naked" objects like `sidebarLayout`.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
shinyUI(navbarPage(
  "Name of App",
  tabPanel("Visualisation",
           fluidPage(
             ## url_allow_popout_UI MUST occur in first tabPanel
             uiOutput("url_allow_popout_UI"),
             plotOutput("chart"),
             ...
))))
```

## source("url_allowPopout.R", local = TRUE)

All of the active components of this template are contained within the `url_allowPopout.R` file, this ensures portability of the code. The code is included into the server file as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
source("url_allowPopout.R", local = TRUE)
```

The `local = TRUE` argument ensures that the code is evaluated within the context of the shinyServer function, allowing the `session` parameter to be queried and `output$url_allow_popout_UI` to be sent to the ui.R file.

## url_allowPopout_check

This uses a reactive expression to parse the query string for "allowPopout", see [reactive expressions tutorial](https://martinjhnhadley.github.io/OxfordIDN_Shiny-App-Templates/advanced-shiny-features/reactive-expressions/) if you're unfamiliar with how `eventReactive` works.

`parseQueryString` is a utility function from the shiny library that returns the query string as a list of key-value pairs. We check whether `allowPopout=="TRUE"`, with the freedom for the user to use any case for "true" but requires "allowPopout" to be written in the correct case.

If `allowPopout=="TRUE"` then the `url_allowPopout_check` reactive expression object is set to `TRUE`, otherwise it is `FALSE`.

## url_allowPopout_icon

This is the function that generates the button:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
url_allowPopout_icon(glyph = ,text = ,link = )
```

- glyph: What icon should be displayed? By default the "fullscreen" from the [Glphyicons for Boostrap](http://getbootstrap.com/components/) collection of excellent icons is used, but you can feasibly use any HTML here (including FontAwesome icons).
- text: What text should be displayed next to the icon?
- link: Automatically extracts the URL of the shiny app, meaning the new window will be spawned with the initial query string.

The function includes a JavaScript function that inserts the popout icon into navbar, the magic is contained within `insertAdjacentHTML` - see [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/insertAdjacentHTML) for the MDN documentation on the method.

## url_allow_popout_UI

Finally, if `url_allowPopout_check == TRUE` then the `url_allowPopout_icon` function is called and the popout icon is shown.
