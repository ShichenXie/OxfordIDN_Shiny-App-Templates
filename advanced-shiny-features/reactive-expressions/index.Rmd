For many users of Shiny, it is simply a tool for building interactive web content with R. Where a user knows a little more about how Shiny works; it is a reactive programming model that allows interactions to be communicated back and forth between a browser (the client or the ui.R file) and a server running R (via the function defined within the server.R file).

This tutorial introduces you to the basics of "reactive expressions", and uses the following Shiny app embedded below as a tutorial. To access the code for the Shiny app click the "Fork me on Github" ribbon in the top-right.

# What is being shown?

The Shiny app generates random data and visualises it in a histogram using, essentially, the following code:

```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
user_selected_mean <- 3
user_typed_title <- "Hello World"
hist(rnorm(100, mean = 3, sd = 1),
     main = user_typed_title)
```

In the ui.R there are two different plots shown::

- histogram_renderPlot has all of it's logic contained within `renderPlot` (and the new data is generated whenever you type)
- histogram_eventReactive has separated the control logic using `eventReactive` (typing does not generate new random data)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
column(
  "Uncontrolled updating",
  plotOutput("histogram_renderPlot"),
  width = 6
),
column(
  "Controlled updating",
  plotOutput("histogram_eventReactive"),
  width = 6
)
```

# histogram_renderPlot

The server.R file contains the following code for generating the "histogram_renderPlot" output:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
output$histogram_renderPlot <- renderPlot({
      hist_data <- rnorm(100, mean = input$mean, sd = 4)
      hist(hist_data,
           main = input$plot_label)
    })
```

**All** `render*` functions behave in the same way; they watch for any changes to `input$*` variables and *invalidate* themselves. Once invalidated, the entire expression re-evaluates. Meaning that any time `input$plot_label` is changed, new `hist_data` values will be computed.

# histogram_eventReactive

There are many options available for controlling the reactivity if a Shiny app ([RStudio provides a wonderful overview of reactivity](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/understanding-reactivity.html)). This template makes use of the simplest available option to us: `eventReactive` 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
hist_data_eventReactive <- eventReactive(c(input$mean),
                                         {
                                           rnorm(100, mean = input$mean, sd = 4)
                                         })
```

The arguments of `eventReactive` are as follows:

- 1st Argument: A vector of `input$*` variables that should be watched
- 2nd Argument: An expression that is invalidated and re-evaluated everytime one of the `input$*` variables in the first argument is changed.

`eventReactive` creates a "reactive expression object" that, when called, will return the output of its second argument. This can be seen in the template app as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
output$histogram_eventReactive <- renderPlot({
  hist_data <- hist_data_eventReactive()
  hist(hist_data,
       main = input$plot_label)
})
```

The `renderPlot` expression retains its reactivity to `input$plot_label`, but now the `hist_data` will only update when the "reactive expression object" `hist_data_eventReactive()` changes.

# Take Away Messages

- `render*` functions are sensitive to every `input$*` change, unless you write additional code
- `eventReactive` is a useful control structure where "this value should be recomputed because X changes"
- You will forget that `hist_data_eventReactive()` needs the `()` to function. Sadly there is not a specific error for this, just try and be careful with your typing.
