<h1>About Page</h1>

<p>
This interactive web application has been built using <a href=http://www.shiny.rstudio.com target="_blank">Shiny</a>, the code is available on <a href="https://github.com/ox-it/OxfordIDN_Shiny-App-Templates" target="_blank">Github here</a>. It demonstrates how one might visualise a dataset with the following properties:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Send/Receive location pairs, for instance a set of journeys.</li>
<li>Each "journey" takes place at a specific time.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The visualisation is produced using the `oidnCharts` library which is designed to compare multiple `htmlwidget` libraries to one another. There is a <a href="http://ox-it.github.io/OxfordIDN_htmlwidgets/geovis/Geolines/" target="_blank">tutorial for building these visualisations from scratch</a> and the `oidnChaRts` <a href="https://github.com/ox-it/oidnChaRts" target="_blank">library itself is available here</a>.
